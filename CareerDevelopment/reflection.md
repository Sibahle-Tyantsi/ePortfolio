## Career Counselling Reflection

**Situation:** I completed a career development topic that included career counseling. It also included a quiz that covered important concepts like goal setting, career planning, hard vs soft skills, and what effective counselling should help someone achieve...  
**Task:** My goal was to complete the task but also understand how these concepts apply on my own career journey and how I can use these to make better decisions going forward...  
**Action:** I went through the learning material carefully and completed the quiz. Whenever I got a question wrong, I took time to read the reason why I got it wrong not to get it right, but to learn from it. I scored 100%, which felt rewarding to me because it showed that I truly understood what I was learning...  
**Result:** Doing this topic made me realize that career development is not just about choosing a job but setting goals that make sense for me, based on what I am good at and what I enjoy...
