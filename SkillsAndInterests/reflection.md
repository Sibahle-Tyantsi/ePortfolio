## Skills and Interests Reflection

**Situation:** I completed skills and interests topic which had to do with my understanding my skills, interests and values. It also included a quiz that covered important concepts like transferable skills, how interests guide career choices and how values play a role in decision-making...  
**Task:** My goal was to complete the task but also take a moment to reflect on how these things apply to me personally, I thought about what I am good at, what I enjoy and what matters to me when it comes to work...  
**Action:** I went through the quiz, didn't get everything right at first, I went back and reviewed what I missed. I ended up getting 100%, which felt rewarding to me because it showed that I truly understood what I was learning...  
**Result:** Completing this topic made me think about where I see myself professionally. I realized that I am drawn to roles that mix creativity with structure like design, tech and project work. This also reminded me on how important it is to choose a career path that reflects not just my skills but also my interests and values...
